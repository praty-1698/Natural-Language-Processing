Implementing different NLP techniques to create a pipeline

Hello Folks!

This is my first NLP repository on Github. I am trying to become a data scientist so using this platform to bloster my coding skills.

I am planning to create a pipeline for cleaning data as well that is further required for different techniques down the line.
I am trying to cover the following in my submission:

1. Word2Vec 
2. Use of Lemmatization and Stemming 
3. Comparative Study of Classification Algorithms on text dataset. Use Case: Spam Detection Classifier

I will also be examining metrics of different algorithms to conclude this study.

Hope you guys like it !!
